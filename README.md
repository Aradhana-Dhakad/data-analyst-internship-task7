#  Task 7 â€” Basic Sales Summary using Python & SQLite

This project is part of my **Data Analyst Internship Task 7**, where the objective was to perform a basic sales data summary using a small SQLite database and Python.

---

##  **Task Description**

- Connect to a **SQLite database** (`sales_data.db`) using Python.
- Run an SQL query to calculate:
   - Total quantity sold per product.
   - Total revenue (`quantity * price`) per product.
- Display the query result using `pandas`.
- Create a simple **bar chart** using `matplotlib` to visualize revenue by product.

---

##  **Tools Used**

- Python
- SQLite (`sqlite3`)
- pandas
- matplotlib

---

##  **Steps Performed**

1. Created a database file `sales_data.db` and a table `sales` using Python.
2. Inserted sample data for various products (product, quantity, price).
3. Wrote an SQL query to summarize:
    - Total quantity sold.
    - Total revenue.
4. Loaded the query results into a **pandas DataFrame** and printed them.
5. Created a **bar chart** with `matplotlib` showing revenue per product.

##  **Learning Outcome**

- Practiced SQL integration inside Python.
- Learned basic SQL queries for sales summary.
- Practiced data visualization with `matplotlib`.
- Understood the `pandas` workflow for handling SQL data in Python.
